# Pokémon Primum

*A total conversion fan project based on the [pret/pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation.*

> The true origin of Pokémon was buried. Now it returns.

**Pokémon Primum** is a complete overhaul of the original Pokémon Emerald engine, reimagined as a new game with entirely custom content:

- 🧠 New Pokémon, types, and lore.
- 🗺️ Custom region, maps, and events.
- 🔮 A mysterious story centered on forgotten truths, false gods, and the power to rewrite history.
- 🌀 Inspired by Hoopa, Arceus, and the clash between myth and reality.
- ⚔️ Gameplay and world design influenced by Kanto, Kalos, and modern entries like Pokémon Violet and Legends: Arceus.

This project uses the decompiled engine of Pokémon Emerald as a foundation, but seeks to explore a totally new direction in gameplay, aesthetics, and narrative.

## 🚧 Status

Currently in early development. The goal is to first strip down all original content and build a modular base for a new game engine using the GBA architecture.

## 🛠️ Based On

This project is a fork of the excellent [pret/pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) repository — a reverse-engineered, source-level recreation of Pokémon Emerald. Major credit and thanks to the [pret](https://pret.github.io/) community for their tireless work in making Pokémon game engines accessible to the public.
